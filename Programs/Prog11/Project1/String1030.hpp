 * The class String1030 is for the students to practice implementing
 * more class functions and making sure that their implementation
 * is reasonable.
 *
 * It requires some skill in using arrays and overloading operators.
 *
 * Note that the sentinel value that MUST be part of the storage for our
 * strings is '\0'.  That is not special, it is just a way to tell future
 * readers that we know what we are doing. We could just as well use the 
 * digit 0, but that can be very confusing.
