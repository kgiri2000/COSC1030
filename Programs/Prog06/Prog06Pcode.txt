1. Create the source file called Prog06.cpp, header file(DWALLVol.hpp) and the cpp file(DWALLVol.cpp).
2.Inside the main function of source file we declare and initilize the variale of height, diameter and thickness in double data type and add header file.
3.Inside do while loop we get the value of all those variable which should be greater than 0 for height and daimeter and less than 
	half of diameter for thickness and  also inside the do while loop we, use while loop to only take the double or integer data type from 
	user else end the program.
	
4.Then, inside the header file we declare the function prototype to calculate the cylinder volume and wall volume.

5.Back to main function we call the cylinder volume function which will return the value of volume of the cylinder.

6.Then, Inside cpp file we add the header file and define the cylinder volume function to get the volume and return it.

7.Again, we inside the header file we declare function prototype to get the volume of wall .

8.Back to main function we call function to measure the volume of wall taking parameter of height, diameter, thickness and the volume of cylinder.

9.Back to cpp file we define the function to calculate the volume of wall which we get by subtracting the volume of whole cylinder subtracted by volume of hollow cylinder
	and print out the volume of the wall.
