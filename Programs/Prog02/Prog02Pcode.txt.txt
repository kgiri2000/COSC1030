1. Set the lowest value(-9999) which can be computed as well as can be used during while loop.
2. Set the temporary variable to store the product of the numbers.
3. Prompt the user to enter the first integer.
4. Prompt the user to enter the second integer. 
5. If the first entered value is smaller than second one and value and greater than the lowest value assigned:
	i.While the smallest integer is less than value1:
		- Assign the smallest integer(-9999) to value1
		- Multiply the temporary product with first value
		- Increase the first integr by 1.
6.Print out the product stored in temporary product variable.
7.If the second entered value is smaller than first entered value and greater than the lowest value assigned(-9999):
	i.While the smallest integer is less than value2:
		- Assign the smallest integer(-9999) to value2
		- Multiply the temporary product with second value.
		- Increase the second integer by 1.
8.Print out the product stored in temporary product variable.
9. Else print the Error! output.
